### üëã Hi there, I'm Manjik Shrestha!

I'm a passionate blockchain developer focused on using decentralized technology to drive social impact and improve financial access for underserved communities. I believe in the power of open-source collaboration and decentralized systems to create real-world solutions beyond cryptocurrency. My projects revolve around bridging the gap between blockchain technology and humanitarian work, with an emphasis on scalability, transparency, and innovation.

### üöÄ Current Projects

#### **Rahat - Financial Access Platform**  
I lead the development of Rahat, a blockchain-based financial access platform that helps humanitarian organizations distribute aid efficiently. Rahat is designed to provide cash voucher assistance (CVA), and I'm currently expanding its capabilities to include microloans and weather-based anticipatory aid using blockchain oracles. Rahat leverages the **Polygon blockchain** for scalable transactions and is being designed to integrate with **Stellar's Soroban** for improved interoperability.
